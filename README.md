# Car Price Prediction Project

Welcome to the Car Price Prediction Project! This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting car prices based on various features. Here's what you need to know about this project:

## Project Overview

This project is all about leveraging machine learning techniques to predict car prices. We've carefully curated a dataset and followed a structured approach to create an accurate model.

## Key Steps

1. **Understanding:** We start by understanding the dataset, exploring the features, and gaining insights into the structure of the data.

2. **Data Cleaning:** We clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and preparing it for further analysis.

3. **Data Visualization:** We use visualizations to uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within the data.

4. **Model Building:** We build a robust linear regression model to predict car prices based on the selected features.

5. **Residual Analysis:** We conduct a thorough analysis of residuals to ensure the model's assumptions are met.

6. **Final Model:** After refining the model, we arrive at a final version with high accuracy.

## Results

Our final model has an impressive R-squared value of 90, indicating that it can explain a significant portion of the variance in car prices based on the chosen features.
